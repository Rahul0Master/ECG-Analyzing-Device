# ECG-Analyzing-Device
In a past decade, the sudden heart attack deaths were increased tremendously. Particularly in a
developing nation like India, apart from genetic and life styles, lack of medical resources in 
rural areas causes most of the fatality in heart attack. In remote areas where even basic health 
facility, ECG monitoring facility is very rare to find. For discarding these situations this ECG 
analyzer device comes into play. This device is used to find the ECG of a person and show the
ECG on a Bluetooth app
